jNetworkInterface
=================

jNetworkInterface and jNetworkInterfaceServer are full open sourced (MIT License) client server objects written in Java that support dynamic command configuration via interface objects in the Commands package.

To get started, simply import the library and follow the Test source code included in this repository to create a client connection and a server. Commands for the server are build in the Commands package and implement the Command interface. The server does the rest.
